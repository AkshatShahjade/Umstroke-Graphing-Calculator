# Umstroke-Graphing-Calculator
Towards the end of my 10th grade, as a part of my IB Personal Project, I created a graphing calculator using python (without the help of pre-existing libraries like matplotlib, etc.)

In this repository, you will find the .exe application files for my graphing calculator, as well as documentation for the development process of how the calculator had been made. The [Pictographic documentation](Documentation/Pictographic_Documentation.docx) 
attempts to explain the inner workings of the code, whereas the [Personal Project (PP) report](../Umstroke-Graphing) is a formal document describing the whole development cycle of this application.
