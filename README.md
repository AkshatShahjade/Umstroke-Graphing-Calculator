# Umstroke-Graphing-Calculator
Towards the end of my 10th grade, as a part of my IB Personal Project, I created a graphing calculator using python (without the help of pre-existing libraries like matplotlib, etc.)

In this repository, under the [Umstroke directory](Umstroke/) you will find the .exe application files for my graphing calculator. The single file is unable to show the icon of the app, whereas the main app can load that .ico image. 

There also exists [Documentation](Documentation/) for the development process of how the calculator had been made. The Pictographic documentation 
attempts to explain the inner workings of the code, whereas the Personal Project (PP) report is a formal document describing the whole development cycle of this application.
